Architecture
Angular was used to create the SPA as the front end language for the webpage created. In angular we used HTML, JavaScript and CSS. CSS is used for style, HTML to display content and JS for the webpage functionality.
For the Backend we used NODE, Node was used to handle the models, views, routes and controllers in the system. 
Since we are using JS, using Mongo DB is a no brainer, we can use JS to write the Mongo database. NoSQL database is great for this project since
NoSQL is used for databases that stores keyValue and multimedia. This helps for the search of different packages stored witrh a specific key value.

Functionality
JSON is used to stored data. The JSON data can be used to pass data from the backend to the front end and renders the data i nthje webpage. JS can convert JSON and thats useful and makes using both together a good combination when developing webpages.
When changing the HTML to handlebars this provide a better functionality and efficiency to the webpage. This is a great example of code refactoring.
Plus with HTML we need to hardcode the data everytime we need to make changes.

Testing
The API endspoints are location in the program where the request are sent. The endpoint are used with methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.
This is used to allow the users the add or delete new data in tho the database. The security is always important to allow the system to be protected agains unauthorized users. 

Reflection
This curse gave me an open window to something new. FullStack is something that is useful and relevant in this times. A lot of webpages are been created and been able to work both sides of the development is definitely a plus. The skill added were HTML, CSS, MEAN development and Mongo DB.
